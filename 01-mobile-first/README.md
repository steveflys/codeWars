Write a function to convert a name into initials. This kata strictly takes two words with one space in between them.
The output should be two capital letters with a dot seperating them.
It should look like this:
Sam Harris => S.H
Patrick Feeney => P.F

Beverly was my partner and she wrote code that was much more dry than I did.  I first attempted to make a variable, split the name, 2 more variables and a .slice to get the first letter from each name and set to upper case.  I had to refer to MDN for the syntax for the split function.

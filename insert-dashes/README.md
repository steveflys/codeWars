Write a function insertDash(num)/InsertDash(int num) that will insert dashes ('-') between each two odd numbers in num. For example: if num is 454793 the output should be 4547-9-3. Don't count zero as an odd number.

It took me 28 minutes to get this done.  I had some help from my artner who directed me to the number methods in MDN for the % method.
